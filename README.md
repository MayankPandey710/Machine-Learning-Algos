## 📂 What’s Included

- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- ✅ Outlier detection and feature preprocessing
- ✅ Beautiful and customized visualizations (box plots, pie charts, histograms, pair plots, heatmaps, etc.)
- ✅ Implementation of:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**
- ✅ Confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy evaluation
- ✅ Model comparison with insights on performance and explainability

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Gender and class significantly impacted survival**
- **Decision Tree** slightly outperformed KNN in terms of accuracy
- **Visual storytelling** helped uncover patterns in age, fare, and family features
- **Decision Tree was more explainable**, showing clear decision paths
